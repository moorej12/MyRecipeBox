# MyRecipeBox
An app for saving recipes that is focused on family recipes.

The objective of this app is to create a beautiful recipe app that allows you to collect and share recipes easily from as many sources as possible, with a focus on allowing non-digital recipes to be added easily.

## Ideas for features
- Manual Add/Edit Recipe page/pages
- Easy browsing of recipes
- Sharing recipes between multiple people to create family cookbooks
- Importing recipes from websites
- Scanning recipes from cards
- Automatic adjustment of ingredient amounts for portion sizes
- Windows, Web, iOS and Android apps

## Techniques and tools you can learn
- App development
- Web development
- Screen Scraping
- Database management
- Optical character recognition
- Design ideas
- Testing
- Feature and requirement analysis
- Project management
- Version control systems
- Working with distributed teams
- and more

Since it is not a urgent project, anyone could work on this, even if you only want to do one part. Just want to try out web development? You can work on the web portion. Want to do some image recognition work? We can just build that part. And if we only get a website, half an iOS app and some designs done, that is just fine. If you are going home for the holidays and still want to participate, then we can all practice working with remote developers (which happens quite often in the real world).
